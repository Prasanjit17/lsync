Its a CLI tool for perfoeming your work easier while doing S3 operations .
Till date we have adde the feature to uplode your files or directory to the S3 bucket accoording to your API credential present in your system and my modifying the bucket name .
It also check the hash of the files and directories , if the file is already present in S2 then it will not get uploded and it will save your resources and time

Just download or clone the repositry present in DEV branch and it is now under development .
For running it in your system you need to have Goland pre-installde , you can do that from https://golang.org/doc/install .
Then just get into the repository and type the go command that is "go install"
Then you are ready to go .
Just use the command in your terminal that is "lsync" and you will get to know more about it , Like how to use and how to process .
It is till now perfectly working with the Linux systems like Ubuntu , MAC , etc .
